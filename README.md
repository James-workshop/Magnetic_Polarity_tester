# Magnetic_Polarity_tester(Magnetic Sniffer Probe)

Working with magnets and want a fast way to tell their NORTHs from their SOUTHs? So I decided to build an electronic one that meets that function.

Advantages:

This circuit is simple and practical, low power consumption. Fewer parts,and the line is simple and easy to understand.

Here is a record of my production process.
